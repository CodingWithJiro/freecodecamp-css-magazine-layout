## A Simple Magazine Layout Page

![Screenshot of the project](./screenshot.png)

This project features a stylized digital magazine layout designed with semantic HTML and modern CSS techniques. The layout mimics a real magazine cover, complete with a title, featured article, smaller stories, and a prominent image section.

It was built entirely with HTML and CSS as part of the **[freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/full-stack-developer/)** CSS course.

## Overview

The magazine layout project uses CSS Grid to structure content into a professional three-column, two-row format. Each section is styled with visual hierarchy, text-shadow effects, and a blended background gradient to evoke a premium editorial feel.

The design adapts well to various screen sizes while preserving the layout integrity, making it a solid introduction to visual composition and responsive design principles.
